# **Value Proposition for Makers Tech**

Makers Tech faces two critical e-commerce challenges: converting undecided visitors into customers and managing inventory efficiently. This AI-powered solution directly addresses both pain points.

The second problem is that customers often leave a site when they have questions or feel overwhelmed by choice, leading to lost sales.
To avoid this, the AI chatbot acts as a 24/7 expert sales associate. It instantly answers product questions and uses a guided questionnaire to understand a customer's specific needs, transforming uncertainty into a confident purchase decision. This directly adds value by reducing cart abandonment and increasing conversion rates.

The first problem is Reactive inventory management causes stockouts on popular items and ties up capital in slow movers.
To address this, our AI-powered chatbot delivers real-time product availability through personalized conversations, helping staff and customers make informed decisions instantly. For admins, a metrics dashboard visualizes stock trends, low-stock alerts, and category-specific counts, enabling proactive restocking and efficient resource allocation.

By solving these core revenue and operational challenges, this platform provides a clear and immediate return on investment.
