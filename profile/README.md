# üéØ Project Objective

This project was developed by **Ricardo Urbina**/[Ricardo965](https://github.com/Ricardo965) to meet the challenge of creating an advanced AI chatbot for **Makers Tech**, a technology e-commerce company. The primary objective was to build a system that enhances the customer journey by providing real-time, personalized information about product inventory, features, and pricing through an intelligent, conversational interface.
